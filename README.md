# Password-Checker
"A project I have been working on to practice my Python skills and to contribute to my CyberSecurity roles."

An extension to what I have previously stated above. What I meant by CyberSecurity contribution was that I thought this would be a great project to create to give me a better practice with Python and give me a better understanding on how a password must be ekpt at a long length using not only characters and numbers but also symbols for better security.

I went ahead and added features telling you if the password is too short and if it meets the requirments I listed in the application to mka esure the password is strong enough for better secuirty.
